# CL-SPATIAL-HASH-GRID

This library allows the easy object oriented usage of a spatial hash grid. Currently it does this only in 2 dimensions.

## Roadmap

The following check list shows what is already done and what is up next.

- [x] Define the data structure 
- [x] Insert entities into the data structure
- [ ] Remove entities from the data structure
- [ ] Update entities inside the data structure
- [ ] Queries to the data structure to find nearest entites and so on

## Current State

This library is not usable in its current state, because we cannot query the data structure. :P
